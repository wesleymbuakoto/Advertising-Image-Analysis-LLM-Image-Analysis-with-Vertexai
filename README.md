# Advertising-Image-Analysis-LLM-Image-Analysis-with-Vertexai
This is an AI implementation of the Gemini LLM in a practical business case. This model has a quick and minor prompt design done to it. The case for this is an Advertising company, it allows its employees to take in a new client and have the client send in a picture of each product. Then the Model will take each product picture and without having to do anything the model will give a short descriptive text, catchy phrase, and poetic description of each product. This will be done in seconds, allowing for more time to focus on fine-tuning.

I have also already prepared safeguards in place like harassment, dangerous content, and etc.
